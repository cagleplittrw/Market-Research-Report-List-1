<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Planned LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction</li><li>Regasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Planned LNG markets are categorized into liquefaction and regasification sectors. The liquefaction market involves converting natural gas into liquid form through cooling, allowing for efficient transport and storage. This process creates facilities that receive raw gas, process it, and export LNG. Conversely, the regasification market focuses on converting LNG back into gas for distribution and consumption. This involves regasification terminals where LNG is received, stored, and vaporized, enabling the gas to be delivered to end-users through pipelines.</p></p>
